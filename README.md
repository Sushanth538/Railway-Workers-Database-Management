# Railway-Workers-Database-Management
I developed the "Railway Workers Database Management System" to manage worker details, scheduling, and job applications efficiently. The system integrates train and tripping data, helping station masters with timely call-outs. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and XAMPP, it enhanced my web development and backend skills.
